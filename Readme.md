# component-hub

Component Hub is an addon for [component](https://github.com/component/component) to help with remote repositories, it can do two things:

 1) *Server:* A `node` server that dynamically clones git repositories based on github-style paths. It serves up components like [Contre](https://github.com/godmodelabs/contre) does except that it will dynamically pull down the git repositories for you and keep them updated.

 A request comes in for /:user/:project/:version/component.json and the hub server will find the repository and clone it if it hasn't already, or update it if it has a copy. Then it just serves the files up to the `Component` installer.

 The repositories are configured via a `hub.json` file that maps the component name to a git location. The git location can be anywhere.

 2) *NPM*: It is also an npm module and command, so that you can call `hub install` and it will fire up the server on demand and install the components, then shut the server down. It basically wraps `component install` with starting and stopping the server.

 When running as a command, it will store the downloaded git repos by default in `~/.component-hub/repos`. It will also look for a `hub.json` in the current working directory. Both of these can be set with environment variables to be wherever you want. Namely, `HUB_REPOS_CACHE` and `HUB_REPOS_JSON`.

## Requirements

 - component version >= 0.11.1 which has support for remotes
 - You must specify your `remotes` in your `component.json` [spec](https://github.com/component/component/wiki/Spec) to use the hub which by default runs at http://localhost:3333. 

## Server Usage

  `$ node app.js`


## NPM Install

  `$ npm install -g component-hub`


## NPM Usage

Once this is in place, you can run `hub install` from the directory where you would usually run `component install`. Any additional arguments are passed along to `component install`.


## hub.json

`hub.json` is looked for in these places 

 1. Using the HUB_REPOS_JSON environment variable.
 2. `~/.component-hub/hub.json` 
 3a. The app directory of the hub server if running as a server.
 3b. The directory of the project you are in if running as command.

Sample contents of the hub.json:

```
{
  "me/otherproject": "git@assembla.com:otherproject.git",
  "company/secretproject": "git@secretlocation.com:secretproject.git"
}
```
